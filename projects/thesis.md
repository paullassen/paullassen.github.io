# **Modelling and Control of an Aerial Manipulator**
On this page I'll present a summary of the work I did for my master's thesis. Some of the work in the thesis was spun off into a paper, submitted to and accepted at the *AIRPHARO 2021 Workshop on Aerial Robotic Systems Physically Interacting with the Environment*.

The full thesis can be found ![here](/assets/MSC_Thesis.pdf). 

## Abstract
Aerial robots have historically been used as flying eyes in the skies. Mounted with sensory payloads, they have been content to use their agility and range to see, smell, and listen to the world around them. More recently, research has begun to tackle the challenges of physical interaction. Unlocking this capability would enable UAVs to take on a much broader range of applications, including tasks which currently pose a risk of injury to the people performing them.

In this post, I'll address the issue of performing physical interaction with the environment by a multi-rotor UAV implementing a basic cascaded position-attitude controller, typical of most of consumer-grade multi-rotor systems. More specifically, I identify mathematically the boundaries where the system can safely be used to perform physical interaction with the environment. These boundaries are then verified both in simulation and by experiment.
