# BeagleBone-Quadracop
The goal of this project is to take the lessons I have learned over the course of the last several years and combine them to build a quadracopter from scratch.

## Background
I finished my Master's Degree in Electrical Engineering a few weeks ago at the beginning of May. I plan on moving back to the US at the end of summer. This hobby project is a way for me to stay active and engaged in a way that is relevant to my learnings. The decision to build a UAV from the ground up has been driven by a desire to tackle the impostor syndrome which I have felt upon completing my degree.

I intend to document my work here so that it will be repeatable by an interested reader.

## Current Status
- 50Hz pulses programmed for all 8 channels using PRU1

## In Progress
- Analysis of I2C
- Acquiring all of the necessary parts
