# **Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topology**
I stumbled upon a paper outlining an algorithm for developing Neural Networks using a genetic algorithm rather than the standard back-prop based machine learning method. The paper in question is entitled [Evolving Neural Networks through Augmenting Topologies](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6790655)

## Background
I finished my bachelor's degree on darkest days of 2016 in the frigid north and found myself with little to do until I was to start a graduate program in Beijing in the Autumn. So naturally I moved back home and bummed around until, in a fit of boredom and inspiration, I decided that I would try my hand at recreating the NEAT algorithm.

## Design Choices
I chose to implement the algorithm in Java for two reasons. First, I am a masochist. Second, Java was the first programming language I learned. So out of some twisted sense of nostalgia I ended up using a language that I hadn't used since my (handwritten) AP Computer Science Exam and which I haven't used since.
