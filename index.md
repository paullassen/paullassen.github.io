## Who am I?
My name is Paul Lassen and I am a recent graduate of the Technical University of Denmark. I have a M.Sc.Eng. in Electrical Engineering with a focus on robotics. 

It am a passionate programmer, who enjoys learning and using new technologies. I am proficient in Python, C/C++, and Matlab, and I have experience with ROS, OpenCV, Matlab/Simulink and other related software.

My main interests lie in the field of robotics, and specifically in areas relating to control systems, deep learning, and autonomous navigation.

I'm looking for a position as a software engineer, where I can use my skills to create innovative and fascinating products.
