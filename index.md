# **Welcome to Paul Lassen's Blog**
This is the corner of the internet where I document my personal projects, blog and curate my online CV.

## Who am I?
My name is Paul Lassen and I would describe myself as a wanderer, a tinkerer, and a gatherer of knowledge which I have no need for. Over the years I have started many small side projects, most of which never made it out of my head.

## Why am I doing this?
My hope is that my showing my work publicly as I do it, I'll get more done out of a deep fear of disappointing you, dear reader. As I type into the void, I hope that maybe, some day, a weary traveler will find themselves searching for the solution to some specific issue which I have overcome and rejoice.
