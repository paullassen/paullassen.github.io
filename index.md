# **Paul Lassen's Blog**
## Welcome

This is the corner of the internet where I document my personal projects and curate my online CV. I've also summarized my master's thesis [here](https://paullassen.com/projects/msc.html).

## Who am I?
My name is Paul Lassen and I am a recent graduate of the Technical University of Denmark. I have a M.Sc.Eng. in Electrical Engineering with a focus on robotics. 

I am a passionate programmer, and I enjoy learning and using new technologies. I mostly program in C/C++, Python and Matlab and I'm experienced with ROS, OpenCV, Matlab/Simulink and I'm always trying to expand my toolbox.

My main focus has been on robotics, specifically in areas relating to control systems, deep learning, and autonomous navigation but I have broad ranging interests from human-computer interfaces, to neuro-science, to embedded systems.
