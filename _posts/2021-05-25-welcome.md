# Welcome to the Blog

**{{ page.date | date: "%A, %d %B %Y"}}**

I've been working on getting a blog section up and running, so that I can describe the problems I'm working on, the approaches I'm taking and the progress I'm making before as they happen. I've already started on the project documentation pages. The project documentation describes what I've done (and what someone else can do) to get to where I'm at. This approach limits the amount of stuff that I can put in the documentation.

I'm hoping that this blog space will allow me to describe all the things that I've tried that haven't worked so far. In its purest essence, this is the place for me to yell into the void and add my thoughts to the turbulent sea of information in which we find ourselves. And maybe, just maybe, you might find some speck of information here useful.
