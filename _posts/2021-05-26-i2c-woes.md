I've been struggling with the I2C connection between the CPU and the IMU/Barometer for a couple of days now. Specifically I've been struggling with getting the PRUs to communicate with the IMU/Barometer over the I2C connection. I had thought that I might have improperly configured the I2C, so I decided to do some debugging with my old pal, the Digilent Analog Discovery.

Using the [BeagleBone Blue Schematic](https://github.com/beagleboard/beaglebone-blue/blob/master/BeagleBone_Blue_sch.pdf), I realised that the I2C1 pins are exposed through one of the JST connectors. Unfortunately, I dont have any wires that fit. No Problem! A quick trip to the local electronics shop revealed that I needed to turn to the internet, so I ordered some parts online. That was on Thursday. The wires arrived today and a quick test revealed that I was getting I2C to work, at least a little. 

So that's where I'm at today, I2C isn't working, but it's correctly configured (on some level). Nothing works and I don't know why could be my motto. In any case I'll do a deep dive into what I'm working on and how I'm trying to solve it by the end of the week.
